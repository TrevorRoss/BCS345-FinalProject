In order for the character to move through the maze, you choose the arrows that point the circle in the right way to move through the puzzle. 
If you choose the wrong arrows, then the circle cannot move.
You can try again as many times as you need to get the character move to the next level. 
If you want to stop playing, then click the "Quit" button at the end of the level or game.
